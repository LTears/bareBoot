A fork of Clover bootloader
(http://sourceforge.net/projects/cloverefiboot)

For legacy BIOS computers only.
No fancy graphics, no black automagic,
no frills, no thrills, no bells & whistles.

Bare "metal" aimed to get kernel running.
The rest should be done by DSDT, kexts, ...

edk2-stable201905 is the latest version to be used for build.
